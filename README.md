# Game of life

This is a simple and naive implementation of the game of life in Go.

Will use [https://github.com/gdamore/tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) v2 for rendering the game.

I try to keep the code simple and separate the logic of the world from the logic of rendering.

At the moment the code support only a square world, but a rectangolar one will be better.
